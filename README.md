# Sulphur

**Sulphur** is a library for creating **instanced GZDoom launchers**.

All files saved by this library are stored under a `sulphur` directory to ensure instances are easily transferrable between implementations.

> âš  Due to its use of the `xdg` crate, this library currently only compiles on **UNIX systems**.
